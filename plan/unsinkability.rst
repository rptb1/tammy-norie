1. Introduction
===============

This document explains how and why I intend to make Tammy Norie unsinkable.


2. Goals
========

_`.goal.survival`

  Increase chance of survival in the case of a hull
  breach or other catastrophic failure at sea, especially on long
  distance solo passages.

_`.goal.save-boat`

  Reduce chance of loss of boat and all it contains.

_`.goal.benefits`

  Provide other benefits such as insulation, soundproofing, and padding.


3. Requirements
===============

_`.req.haven`

  Boat remains a safe haven in the case of a hole in the hull which
  can't be fixed for days.

_`.req.chop`

  If you break the boat into pieces, most of them float and some of
  them are liferafts.

_`.req.suitable`

  Suitable for Tammy Norie.

_`.req.time`

  Can be fitted by me in reasonable time [clarify].

_`.req.cost`

  Material costs less than GBP 1000.

_`.req.maintainable`

  Maintainable.

_`.req.removable`

  Can be removed and replaced with reasonable cost and effort.

_`.req.access`:

  Must not impair access to equipment or fittings.

  _`.req.access.seacocks`

    Must allow inspection and free access to seacocks in a hurry.
    Must allow for seacocks to be plugged in an emergency.

  _`.req.access.wiring`

    Must allow inspection and maintenance of electrical wiring --
    instrument, radio antenna, and lighting.

  _`.req.access.deck-fittings`

    Must allow access to the fasteners of deck fittings in the
    ceiling.

_`.req.safe`

  Must not introduce other hazards: fire, poison, access, etc.

  _`.req.non-flammable`

  The materials most not readily catch fire or burn or produce toxic
  fumes when burning.

  _`.req.non-toxic`

  The materials must be inert and not be toxic, since I will be
  exposed to them a great deal.


4. Design
=========


Overview
--------

Use closed-cell foam to displace over 1 tonne of seawater, making the
boat bouyant even if totally submerged.  [What is the margin of
error?]

Most of the foam will be stuck to the interior of the boat as a
lining, also providing insulation and padding for comfort.

The interior cushions will also be replaced with closed-cell foam
cushions, so that they cannot take up water.  These will be secured to
the interior by some means so that they do not detach when the boat is
flooded [what means?].

All accessible unused voids will be filled with foam, particularly the
cockpit coamings.

Additional precautions include storing as much as possible in
watertight containers and bags which are half-filled with air.

The foam will need to be covered with a lining to protect its surface
and to reflect light, since it is usually matt black.  Conventional
vinyl headlining material is probably the right thing.


Volumes
-------

These are the volumes within the boat where air can be replaced by foam.

_`.vol.sides`

  The boat interior sides.  This is the area of the hull that is
  exposed in the boat cabin and forms the "walls".  This could be
  padded quite thickly but it would be nice to keep this fairly thin
  to avoid reducing the living area.

_`.vol.ceiling`

  The boat interior ceiling, mostly comprising the underside of the
  coachroof, but also some of the underside of the foredeck.  This
  will need to be fairly thin to avoid bringing down the ceiling
  height in the accommodation, which is already fairly low.  It must
  also have numerous holes to allow access to the fasteners for deck
  fittings.  It may be possible to make cosmetic plugs for these
  holes.

  The biggest difficulty I anticipate is holding up the ceiling
  lining.  This is a notoriously difficult problem on boats.  Gluing
  tends to be temporary in this context.  My main idea for solving
  this is to epoxy wooden blocks or strips to the ceiling to provide a
  purchase for some sort of screws or other fasteners (see
  `.idea.chesterfield`_).

_`.vol.cushions`

  The existing boat cushions are in good condition even after 36
  years, but they are made of absorbent foam with woven wool covers.
  They would not provide floatation for very long, and in any case
  tend to take up moisture over time.

  Annie Hill warns that closed-cell foam cushions can be uncomfortably
  hard [ref?  It's a comment on the blog.].

_`.vol.quarter-berth`

  Although this is part of the cabin it deserves some special
  attention.  The quarter berth runs under the starboard cockpit seat
  and has a wooden bulkhead on the port side adjoining the
  `.vol.under-cockpit`_.  It is a fairly large volume and is my main
  sleeping area.  As such it could be quite thickly lined for both
  comfort and buoyancy.  The berth is also home to clothing and
  equipment bags when I'm not in it.

  I need to do some experiments to see how much space I need for
  comfortable fidgeting while sleeping. [TODO]

_`.vol.coamings`

  The Coromandel has high and broad cockpit coamings that are part of
  the deck mould.  On the starboard side, the coaming forms a large
  void above the `.vol.quarter-berth`_.  (It had a clothes hanging
  rail in when I first got Tammy Norie.)  This void is not very
  useful.  On the port side, the coaming forms a large void above the
  `.vol.cockpit-locker`_.  This is a little bit useful if you can
  stack objects in the locker, but would be no great loss to foam.
  The very aft part of the coamings open in to the
  `.vol.engine-locker`_ and the `.vol.quarter-locker`_.

  The coamings have the advantage that foam can be wedged into them
  quite tightly and is unlikely to come loose.  On the other hand,
  they are quite high above the waterline and so will only provide
  floatation when the boat is very submerged.

_`.vol.under-cockpit`

  The Coromandel has a large compartment below the cockpit where an
  internal engine might have been fitted, though I have never come
  across one.  This is extremely useful storage that I use for the
  battery, parts, and tools.  It also contains: two cockpit drain
  seacocks; the hose from the bilge to the bilge pump; the gas alarm;
  the battery shut-off switch and circuit breaker; the electrical
  conduit to the stern.

  A loss of volume in this compartment would be quite hard to bear
  forward, but not so much aft, where the battery is mounted.  This
  part is quite hard to access without crawling, so could not only be
  lined thickly with foam, but could also store containers full of
  air.  It may be possible to form some foam into a mounting for
  various containers, as is done in photographic cases, so that they
  are held firmly.  For example, the tupperware tubs of fasteners,
  electrical parts, etc. could be jammed in effectively.

  The bottom of this compartment is a channel (with the bilge pump hose
  in it) that acts as a drain forward to the bilge.  It's probably
  best to leave this exposed.

_`.vol.engine-locker`

  The starboard quarter locker holds the outboard engine, which
  protrudes through a hole in to the water.  The lower part of this
  locker is normally flooded, and much more of it floods when the boat
  is heeling.  The locker also holds the main fuel tank on its forward
  shelf.

  The locker has a lot of unused volume.  The upper parts could be
  lined to at least 100mm without restricting airflow around the
  engine, and possibly much more.  The locker lid could also be lined
  with thin foam.  This has the extra advantage of helping to reduce
  engine noise, especially when cruising with the locker closed.

  Foam could also help to wedge the fuel tank more securely in the
  locker.  When sailing, the locker does flood quite deeply and the
  fuel tank is sometimes afloat.

  Conditions in this locker are quite harsh and the foam's backing
  adhesive may not be enough to hold it in place.  It may be possible
  to epoxy wooden blocks to the bulkheads and screw the foam in place
  using large washers.

_`.vol.quarter-locker`

  The port quarter locker is a large storage volume.  It also holds
  the gas bottle and the body of the bilge pump.  The electrical
  connections from the cabin protrude into this locker through a tight
  hole.  The bottom of the locker accesses a kind of tunnel that
  awkwardly reaches the engine mounting bolts.  This tunnel should not
  be blocked, but could hold removable airtight containers.  In any
  case, it would be very hard to line with foam.

  Currently I use this locked for a 50 litre spare water container,
  the spare fuel tank, the inflatable dinghy, and various
  flammable engine-related materials such as oil and carburettor cleaner,
  as well as spare butane for the soldering iron.  It also houses the
  bilge pump handles, the hand pump, a drain unblocking water jet,
  funnel and tubing, and a few other gas- or fuel- related items.

  Loss of volume here could be a little tricky as the dinghy fits
  quite snugly with the 50 litre spare water.  Some experimentation
  will be required.

  The aft part of this locker joins with part of the `.vol.coamings`_.

_`.vol.cockpit-locker`

  The port-side seat of the cockpit lifts to provide access to a large
  locker that is the equivalent of the quarter berth on the starboard
  side.  This locker also contains the heads seacocks, and the copper
  gas pipe passes through it, attached to the starboard bulkhead.  At
  the forward bottom there is access to a void underneath the heads
  compartment sole.  It also adjoins most of the port
  `.vol.coamings`_.  The locker is used to store a large amount of
  equipment that might be needed while sailing: ropes, bucket, flares,
  kedge anchor, fenders, etc.

  Although this locker often appears full, tidying it always makes it
  half empty, and it could be lined with quite thick foam.  More foam
  might be used to make mountings for various items, so that they
  wedge in tightly.  Access to the seacocks and plumbing must be
  maintained, but in fact could be improved by defending the seacocks
  with foam recesses.  The base of this locker must drain forward
  under the heads compartment sole and in to the main bilge, so it is
  in some sense "inside" the boat.  The drainage channel should remain
  clear.  It may also make sense to stuff spare foam in sheets under
  the heads compartment sole, but there is not a great deal of volume
  there.

_`.vol.interior-lockers`

  The Coromandel has a fibreglass liner that forms most of the
  interior bunks.  There is a void on both sides of the boat beneath
  these bunks, with access through locker lids.  The void joins with
  the area under the forward V-berth, which houses the mast step and a
  large triangular area forward of the mast.

  On Tammy Norie, the starboard void contains the flexible 200 litre
  water tank.  Thie does not actually inflate to contain 200 litres,
  but fills the available space.  Lining the void with foam would
  reduce water capacity.

  The port void is used for food storage.  It is a little awkward to
  reach, and food is contained within sealed tupperware containers
  that are thrust into the void and pulled out as needed.  This void
  could be lined, at the cost of loss of stowage.

  The mast step is a wet area that also houses food storage
  containers.  It is moderately hard to access.  On the starboard
  side, near the mast step, is the through-hull fitting for the log,
  and a seacock for the sink drain.  Both of these could benefit from
  protection by foam recesses.

  The forward triangle locker is also used for food storage.  It is
  quite accessible through a large lid and could be effectively lined.

  It may be difficult and unnecessary to attach the foam very firmly to the hull
  or liner in these voids, since it is very unlikely to escape in the
  case of flooding.  In the case of the mast step, which is made of
  wood that tends to get wet, it is probably best to allow air
  circulation and encourage evapouration as much as possible.
  Certainly it's necessary to inspect the step regularly.

Notes
-----

_`.idea.cushion-straps`

  Cushions could perhaps be made with webbing straps that attach to
  pad eyes on the cabin liner.

_`.idea.fixed-cushions`

  What if the cabin liner has a layer of foam glued to the top in
  addition to cushions.  The cushions could be more conventional,
  possibly solving Annie Hill's objection [ref?].

_`.idea.fewer-cushions`

  Since I'm remaking cushions and storing the originals, what cushions
  do I actually need?

_`.idea.chesterfield`

  Some kind of fasteners to tighten the surface lining against the
  foam "stuffing" and so produce an attractive effect like a
  Chesterfield sofa, as well as securing the foam.  The fasteners
  would need to flexible and not have sharp edges, especially on the
  ceiling.  Probably needs prototyping.

_`.idea.pad-eyes`

  How does this interact with the idea of strapping in bags etc. using
  pad eyes attached to the hull in the manner of mini transat racers?
