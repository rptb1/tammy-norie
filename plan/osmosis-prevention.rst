1. Introduction
===============

This document explains how and why I intend to protect Tammy Norie's
hull against osmosis.

Almost every other Newbridge Coromandel I have come across has
suffered from osmosis.  It's well-known that polyester resins from a
particular period are susceptible to osmosis [citation required].
It's therefore reasonable to assume that Tammy Norie is susceptible.

Although osmosis is not critical to a boat's safety, it is expensive,
difficult, and time-consuming to treat.  It is also quite easy to
prevent.  It therefore seems like a very good idea to take steps to
prevent it!


2. Goals
========

_`.goal.prevent`

  Make is very unlikely that osmosis blistering will occur in Tammy
  Norie's hull.


3. Requirements
===============

_`.req.effective`

_`.req.time`

_`.req.cost`

_`.req.durable`

_`.req.maintainable`


4. Design
=========

_`.design.barrier`: Apply an epoxy-based barrier coat to Tammy Norie's
hull below the waterline.  Epoxy is much [ref?] less permeable to
water than polyester, and this should reduce the possibility of the
polyester resin going into solution and causing blistering and
delamination.

_`.design.dry`: Dry out Tammy Norie's hull as far as possible to
reduce the possibility that trapped water will dissolve the resin and
cause blistering or delamination.  It's a good idea to do this before
`.design.barrier`_ so that drying can occur through both the inside
and outside of the hull.  [NOTE: Conflicts with
`plan.unsinkability.design.displace`_ which will tend to seal off the
interior sides.]

5. Plan
=======

_`.plan.lift`: Lift Tammy Norie out of the water.

_`.plan.clean`: Clean sea life from the hull to help speed
`.design.dry`_.

_`.plan.scrape`: Scrape off existing antifouling to expose gel coat to
the air to speed `.design.dry`_.

_`.plan.dry-bilge`: Manually dry as much of the bilge as possible
using absorbtion with sponges, paper, and by cleaning away any
moisture-retaining dirt.

_`.plan.fan`: Use a fan to force airflow around the inside of Tammy
Norie's hull, especially the bilges, to evapourate water from the
surface and speed `.design.dry`_.

_`.plan.tent`: Build a tent over Tammy Norie so that she does not get
rained on and can be opened up to a greater volume of air during the
winter.

[TBD]
